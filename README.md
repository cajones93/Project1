## Design & Planning:

### User Stories
Write your user stories in this section
### Wireframes
Attach wireframes in this section
### Typography
I searched for a suitable font pairing on [fontpair.co](https://www.fontpair.co/pairings/oswald-source-sans-pro). I liked the look of this font as I think they fit with the spooky theme for the website. Source Sans Pro was unavailable on Google Fonts so I went with Source Sans 3 which is very similar.

### Colour Scheme

- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.

The site was deployed to Github Pages using the following method:
- Go to the Github repository.
