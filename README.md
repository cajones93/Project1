## Design & Planning:

### User Stories
Write your user stories in this section

#### User 
As a user, I want to be able to:

- browse available paranormal experiences so that I can see the different options available.
- view detailed information about the paranormal experiences so that I can clearly understand what is included in each service.
- submit a contact form so that I can reach out to the organiser for more information or to book an experience.
- view basic pricing information so that I know how much each experience costs.
- get directions to the haunted house locations where paranormal experiences take place, so I know how to get there.
- read an FAQ section to quickly find answers to common questions.
- view social media links so that I can follow or share the page with others.

#### Site Owner
As the site owner, I want to be able to:
- display all the necessary information clearly so that users can easily understand what services are offered and how to contact me.
- provide a simple contact form so that potential customers can reach out for bookings or inquiries.
- embed social media links to increase visibility and encourage users to share the page with their networks.
- ensure the page looks good on mobile devices so that users have a smooth browsing experience.

### Wireframes
Attach wireframes in this section
### Typography
I searched for a suitable font pairing on [fontpair.co](https://www.fontpair.co/pairings/oswald-source-sans-pro). I liked the look of this font as I think they fit with the spooky theme for the website. Source Sans Pro was unavailable on Google Fonts so I went with Source Sans 3 which is very similar.

### Colour Scheme
Screenshoot of the colour scheme for your project

## Features:
Explain your features on the website,(navigation, pages, links, forms.....)
### Navigation
The website consists of three sections (Home, About, Contact) with navigation elements that link to each.
When viewed on a mobile device, the navigation elements are condensed into a collapsed list.

### Footer
The footer contains links to social media sites Facebook, Youtube, Instagram, and WhatsApp.

### Other features
## Technologies Used
List of technologies used for your project...
HTML
CSS
Bootstrap
Github
## Testing
Important part of your README!!!
### Google's Lighthouse Performance
Screenshots of certain pages and scores (mobile and desktop)
### Browser Compatibility
Check compatability with different browsers
### Responsiveness
Screenshots of the responsivness, pick few devices (from 320px top 1200px)
### Code Validation
Validate your code HTML, CSS (all pages/files need to be validated!!!), display screenshots
### Manual Testing user stories or/and features
Test all your user stories, you an create table 
User Story |  Test | Pass
--- | --- | :---:
paste here you user story | what is visible to the user and what action they should perform | &check;
- and attach screenshot

## Bugs

Images not showing in services section.
- Was missing "assets/" from the file path.

FAQ 3, 4, 5 buttons expand/collapse all 3 together
- ID was set to "collapseThree" for all 3 buttons. Changing IDs fixed the problem. 

## Deployment

#### Creating Repository on GitHub
- First make sure you are signed into [Github](https://github.com/) and go to the code institutes template, which can be found [here](https://github.com/Code-Institute-Org/gitpod-full-template).
- Then click on **use this template** and select **Create a new repository** from the drop-down. Enter the name for the repository and click **Create repository from template**.
- Once the repository was created, I clicked the green **gitpod** button to create a workspace in gitpod so that I could write the code for the site.
#### Deloying on Github
The site was deployed to Github Pages using the following method:
- Go to the Github repository.
- Navigate to the 'settings' tab.
- Using the 'select branch' dropdown menu, choose 'main'.
- Click 'save'.
